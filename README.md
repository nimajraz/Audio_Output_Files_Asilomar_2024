Three variables for playback stored in .mat file. First is the recovered secondary audio in recovered_sig. Then, the audio of the primary while the secondary is playing in during_transmission_primary_audio. Finally, the entire received data stream of the receiver before, during, and after the secondary transmits in full_primary_audio.  You can play it with sound( (variable name), Fs) in MATLAB. Each of these variables was also converted into .wav files.
